# Puzzle_Play_Offs_WDI_Project_1
Puzzle Play-Offs is an online jigsaw puzzle game for two players.
This app is based around the draggable and droppable functions for the jQuery UI's libaray. I created two levels for this game, easy and hard. The biggest challenge on this project was incorporating the shapes of the puzzle pieces, and making sure these pieces snapped into place once placed correctly.

Used: JavaScript, Photoshop, jQuery, jQueryUI
